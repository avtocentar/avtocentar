This project involved the development of a Car Selling Website, where I gained practical knowledge and hands-on experience in **front-end web technologies**.  

Throughout the project, I worked on creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces, implementing dynamic components, and ensuring smooth navigation for an enhanced user experience.  

The project helped me strengthen my skills in:
- **HTML**
